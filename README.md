# MASS Client - Mutual Aid & Shared Services
# Client Boilerplate With React

Modified create-react-app to setup:

- [x] Context with Provider wrap happening in index.js
- [x] BrowserRouter with wrap happening in index.js
- [x] Basic routes and their components
- [x] Light styling with CSS to be web/app responsive

Main styling is done in App.css. NavBar and Footer have their own css files(./src/Components/Styling)
This boilerplate is meant to get you straight into building your app without having you spend time setting up the basics.
Routes taken from [reactrouter documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start).
I plan on adding more to this boilerplate while sticking to the nature of a boilerplate.
