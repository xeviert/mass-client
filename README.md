## Live App: https://mass-client.vercel.app/about

### Technologies Used

- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For styling components and creating a consistent, responsive design.

### Description

The Mutual Aid & Shared Services project is a web application designed to facilitate the connection between people in need and those who can help within a community. The platform supports a mutual aid organization by enabling users to request items they need and allowing administrators to manage and fulfill these requests. In the future, the platform will also support a donor view where individuals can see what items are needed most and contribute accordingly.

### Features
#### User Wishlist
- **Request Aid**: Users can create a wishlist of items they need by selecting from a predefined list. They can specify the quantity of each item and provide their location/address for delivery.

- **Real-Time Updates**: As new items are added to the wishlist, the application updates in real-time to reflect the current needs of the community.
#### Admin Dashboard
- **Manage Requests**: Admins have access to a dashboard where they can view and manage all incoming requests. Each request displays the userâ€™s contact information, location, and the list of requested items.
- **Order Fulfillment**: Admins can track the status of each request and update it as items are fulfilled.

#### Donor View (Planned Feature)
- **View Needed Items**: Donors will be able to see which items are most needed based on current requests. This will help prioritize donations and ensure that the most urgent needs are met.
- **Contribute Items**: Donors can choose to contribute items directly through the platform, simplifying the donation process and ensuring that contributions are directed where they are needed most.
